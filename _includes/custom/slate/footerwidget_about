			Research and Experimentation for Local and International First-Responders (RELIEF) is a field exploration that occurs under the Joint Interagency Field Explorations (JIFX) at the Naval Postgraduate School each quarter. It is one of the few places where humanitarians are encouraged to fail: to break existing tools under harsh conditions and new requirements. It is also one of the only neutral spaces between the military and humanitarians, who must often coordinate around logistics, airlift, medical operations, and security.
