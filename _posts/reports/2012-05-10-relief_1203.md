<h2>Tentative Agenda</h2>
<p>The Agenda is still under development. It provides a basic framework for the day. That said, what makes Camp Roberts unique is our ability to engage in the equivalent of jazz sessions for technologists. We open a space for improvisations to occur which are not possible under normal conditions. Since we are NOT an aquisition environment (we are formally an 'experiment'), we can bring the owners of the problem in the USG together with technologists and open a space for cross-vendor, cross-agency collaborations to occur. While formality to the schedule is important in DC (everyone is overscheduled), we also want to keep this essential improvisatory element that we have when we work in the field environment in California; this agenda is the compromise.</p>
<p>Note: food and drinks are available in the NDU cafeteria down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>Event is free</strong>, though registration is required [ see <a href="http://npsrelief.org">http://npsrelief.org</a> ]</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>Via METRO: Fort McNair is located about one-half mile from the Washington Metroâ€™s Waterfront station on the Green Line. Leaving the station, cross Maine Avenue and walk south down 4th Street for three blocks until it ends and, turning left, becomes P Street SW. The Fort McNair main gate will be plainly visible on the immediate right. Ask the guards for Lincoln Hall. Go to the security desk and then to room 1119. <a href="http://www.ndu.edu/info/visitingNDU.cfm">NDU's directions page can be found here</a>.</p>
